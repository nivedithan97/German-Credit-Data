# German-Credit-Data
In this project, I want to obtain a model that may be used to predict whether a new customer is at risk of defaulting a borrowed loan. I will be exploring different types of classification models such as:
• Decision Tree
• Naïve Bayes
• Bagging
• Boosting
• Random Forest
• Artificial Neural Networks
